# FPGA Projects/Labs by Luis Cortina
For most of these labs, they were designed and implemented by first verifying correctness through behavioral simulation and then were loaded onto an FPGA where a testing program was ran to verify the design on-board an FPGA.

FPGA used: Zybo Z7-10 Development Board (Xilinx Zynq-7000 family)

Development tool: Vivado 2018.3

Please excuse missing READMEs and code without comments. I am continuously fixing this when I have time.
